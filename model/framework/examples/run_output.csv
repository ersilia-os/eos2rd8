mol_description
The molecule is a methyl ester resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of N-(2 6-dimethylphenyl)-L-alanine with methanol. It is a methyl ester and a member of benzamides. It derives from a N-(2 6-dimethylphenyl)-L-alanine.
The molecule is a terpene ketone in which a (9E 13E 15E)-geranylgernayl group is bonded to one of the alpha-methyls of acetone (it is a mixture of 5E- and 5Z-geoisomers in a 3:2 ratio). It has a role as an anti-ulcer drug  a cardioprotective agent  a hepatoprotective agent  a nephroprotective agent  a neuroprotective agent and a Hsp70 inducer. It is a methyl ketone and a terpene ketone. It contains a geranylgeranyl group.
The molecule is a fatty amide obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of o-naphthalen-2-ylcinnamic acid with the amino group of 1-[2-(benzyloxy)ethyl]-1H-pyrazol-3-amine. It is a member of pyrazoles  a member of naphthalenes and a fatty amide. It derives from an o-naphthalen-2-ylcinnamic acid.
